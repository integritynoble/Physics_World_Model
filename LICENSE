======================================

Copyright (c) 2026 PWM Contributors

This license governs use of the PWM software and associated documentation,
examples, configuration files (including CasePacks), and any other materials
distributed with the PWM repository (collectively, the "Software").

IMPORTANT: This is a source-available license. It permits non-commercial use
and requires that modifications be published under the same terms.

1. Definitions
--------------
1.1 "You" (or "Your") means an individual or legal entity exercising
    permissions granted by this License.

1.2 "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Software for making
    modifications, including all files required to build, run, and test it,
    and any scripts used to control compilation and installation.

1.3 "Modified Version" means any work that is based on (derived from) the
    Software, including any modifications, adaptations, translations, or
    additions to the Software.

1.4 "Non-Commercial Use" means use that is not primarily intended for or
    directed toward commercial advantage, monetary compensation, or other
    business benefit.

1.5 "Commercial Use" includes, without limitation:
    (a) selling, licensing, or otherwise monetizing the Software or any
        Modified Version;
    (b) providing the Software or any Modified Version as part of a paid
        product or service (including SaaS, hosted APIs, consulting packages
        where the Software is a material component, or embedded offerings);
    (c) using the Software or any Modified Version in internal business
        operations where the primary purpose is commercial advantage,
        including in production workflows that directly support revenue-
        generating activities;
    (d) redistributing the Software or any Modified Version for a fee.

    For clarity, the following are generally considered Non-Commercial Use:
    academic research, teaching, personal projects, and evaluation, provided
    they are not part of a paid offering or revenue-generating service.

1.6 "Publish" means to make available to the public under terms that permit
    access and copying (for example, a public Git repository or a publicly
    accessible archive download).
